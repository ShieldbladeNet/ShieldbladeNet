# Nano R1S R2S R4S x86 Openwrt 
 
### Download Linkï¼š
https://github.com/ShieldbladeNet/Nano-Openwrt/releases  
(Files do not need to be decompressed, you can directly use the flashing tool to flash in img.gz)

### Use suggestions:
The default user name is root, the password is password, and the LAN IP is 192.168.2.1
After burning the firmware, insert the tf card and start it up. After the computer displays "Network (Connected)", enter http://immortalwrt/ in the browser to directly open the router background without modifying the local connection settings or checking the IP address.
If the network status has been unrecognized (more than 5 minutes after power-on), please plug in and unplug the power directly and restart it.

### Online upgrade method in the terminal:
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/ShieldbladeNet/Nano-Openwrt/raw/main/scripts/autoupdate.sh | sh
```
slim Version
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/ShieldbladeNet/Nano-Openwrt/raw/main/scripts/autoupdate.sh | ver=-slim sh
```
(Script provided by Gary Lau, thank you very much!)

### Firmware features:
-The slim version firmware has only the OpenWrt body, but it has a built-in "local software source", which contains most of the commonly used plug-ins. Those who don't like the firmware pre-installed complicated plug-ins can choose this version and enter the background software package to install the required plug-ins
-Using the ext4 file system, you can use the partition tool to expand the root partition of the SD card to the maximum after swiping the card
-Support USB wireless network card (RTL8821CU chip, such as COMFAST 811AC), which can drive the wireless network card to run in the 5G frequency band
-When using [online upgrade] (#online upgrade method in terminal), the root partition will automatically expand, which is convenient for tossing
